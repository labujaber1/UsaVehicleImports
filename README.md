# UsaVehicleImports

Remake of an existing wordpress/bootstrap hosted static local business website.

Remake uses html, bootstrap5, custom css, and javascript containing content and images from the original site.

Content has had some slight modification to fix grammatical and spelling errors while images have had some attention to make them pop a little better.

A customer enquiry form is included using formspree.com to handle email services.

Stock inventory read from a json file and created dynamically in cards. No database is used. No security is implemented while using json file.

A single page site with a navbar and footer.
